<h2>Our Legacy</h2>
<p> <b>Fashion Nova was founded in 2006 by CEO Richard Saghian,</b> who identified a gap in the women's apparel market for affordable, stylish clubwear and jeans. Initially starting as a brick-and-mortar store in Southern California, the brand quickly gained popularity and leveraged social media, particularly Instagram, to connect with customers and promote its products. Over the years, Fashion Nova has grown significantly, employing over 600 staff and becoming a major player in the fast fashion industry.</p>
